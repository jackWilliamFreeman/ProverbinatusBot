# ProverbinatusBot

an absolutely trash tier ECS fargate hosted discord bot to annoy people and generally just be terrible at things.

It has two files quotes.py and birthdays.py that will define a dictionary and return it via a method, these can be imported as pseudo modules until i can be arsed making them real modules. In reality they need to just be a thin interface and one day i can migrate their content to a more persistant backend that is free (aka a fantasy that will never happen.)

You can add quotes to the quotes.py and you can add a birthday to the birthdays.py file. Just make sure its a valid dictionary ffs.
